## 🏢 Dynamic Family Hub Dashboard With Home Assistant

Disclaimer: I am not a programmer! I do this as a hobby and because I like to break stuff! Enjoy!

A premium, ambient dark-mode home automation command center designed for multi-profile layouts. This ecosystem handles dual-frontend presentation layers seamlessly syncing via an asynchronous MQTT pipeline connected to Home Assistant integrations and a Telegram chatbot orchestration layer.

## Telegram Integration Notes 
You will need to create a Bot in your Telegram account, many tutorials are out there. You will need TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN to be put into .env file, use the files provided with -example and just remove "-example" from them and they are good to go with your own details.
Once your Telegram Bot is up and runnig you can add it to your existing family group or better still create a new group for this dashboard and add members, also make sure you make the Bot admin to have access to your group messages where the Bot is added. 

## Where to run?
I am running this on a proxmox LXC instance but you can run on Raspbery Pi from Zero 2W upto Pi 5! 
You can also run on an old pc/laptop. The project really doesnt need much resources.
* For Kiosk LCD screen/monitor in Portrait mode, all it would need is a sigle webpage of "http://yourIntance'sIP:8080/kiosk" this can be run on Pi Zero W2 with dietPi OS and Cog Browser by following PiZero2W_KioskSetupGuide.pdf, which would launch at startup without any desktop with above url, this setup uses about 350mb of RAM and few % of CPU! This is 1080p portrait setup.
  
* You can access non kiosk dashboard at "http://yourIntance'sIP:8080/dashboard" From any PC/Laptop, Mobile Phone or Tablet.

## ⚡ Architecture Overview

* **🖥️ Kiosk Interface (`/kiosk`):** Hard-locked portrait dimension configuration tailored perfectly for a dedicated vertical 1080p monitor.
* **📱 Mobile Web Client (`/dashboard`):** Fluid, glassmorphic (`backdrop-filter`) auto-wrapping card array matching the kiosk aesthetic while adjusting flawlessly to handheld touch screens.
* **🤖 Telegram Bot Dispatcher:** A Python-driven SQLite backend layer acting as a remote management pipeline. Interacts with the family on the go to inject custom sticky notes, manipulate real-time grocery lists, and handle calendar adjustments.
* **📡 Async MQTT Service Broker:** The real-time messaging highway utilizing Mosquitto to stream state changes across layouts instantly.
* **🏡 Home Assistant Engine integration:** Pushes live local system data such as regional precise Adhan times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and localized weather conditions.

🚀 Deployment Guide
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your host server machine:
```
curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com) -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

2. Environment Configurations
Rename a local .env-example to .env configuration template in the root directory, file contains credentials as below.

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_secure_api_token_here
MQTT_BROKER=your_mqtt_broker_ip
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USER=your_mqtt_username
MQTT_PASS=your_mqtt_password
```
3. Spin Up the Container Infrastructure
Compile your deployment profile production assets and start the system containers detached:

## Build frontend assets via Vite
rename the .env-example to .env, this needs credentials as below
```
VITE_MQTT_BROKER_WS=ws://mqtt-ip-address:9001
VITE_MQTT_USER=mqtt_user
VITE_MQTT_PASS=mqtt_password
```
Input your credentials in above .env file which is in "dashboard" folder/dir, save the file and then run below command while you are in the "family-dashboard" folder/dir.

it will cd to "dashboard" folder/dir and will build the react app.

```
cd dashboard && npm install && npm install npx && npx vite build && cd ..
```
## Launch core runtime structures

Rename the meal_plan.json-example to meal_plan.json and update as your own weekely meal plan.

This must run inside the folder/dir  "family-dashboard"
```
docker compose up -d --build
```
## 📡 Integrations

Home Assistant yaml example files are provided in a seperate folder you can use them and change necessory details for your own Devices and Entities.

Add HA details to the .env file
```
HA_URL=http://your-ha-instance:8123
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_ha_token
```

## 🤖 Here is the complete list of triggers and keywords to use with your Telegram Bot.
