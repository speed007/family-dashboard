## 🏢 Dynamic Family Hub Dashboard With Home Assistant

Disclaimer: I am not a programmer! I do this as a hobby and because I like to break stuff! Enjoy!

A premium, ambient dark-mode home automation command center designed for multi-profile layouts. This ecosystem handles dual-frontend presentation layers seamlessly syncing via an asynchronous MQTT pipeline connected to Home Assistant integrations and a Telegram chatbot orchestration layer.

## Telegram Integration Notes
You will need to create a Bot in your Telegram account (many tutorials are out there). Put your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in the root `.env` file — copy `.env-example` to `.env` and fill in your details.
Once your Telegram Bot is up and running you can add it to your existing family group or better still create a new group for this dashboard and add members, also make sure you make the Bot admin to have access to your group messages where the Bot is added.

## Where to run?
I am running this on a Proxmox LXC instance but you can run on a Raspberry Pi from Zero 2W up to Pi 5!
You can also run on an old pc/laptop. The project really doesnt need much resources.
* For Kiosk LCD screen/monitor in Portrait mode, all it would need is a single webpage of `http://your-instance-ip:8080/kiosk` this can be run on Pi Zero 2W with dietPi OS and Cog Browser by following `PiZero2W_KioskSetupGuide.pdf`, which would launch at startup without any desktop with above URL. This setup uses about 350 MB of RAM and a few % of CPU! This is a 1080p portrait setup.
  
* You can access the non-kiosk dashboard at `http://your-instance-ip:8080/dashboard` from any PC, laptop, mobile phone or tablet.

## ⚡ Architecture Overview

* **🖥️ Kiosk Interface (`/kiosk`):** Hard-locked portrait dimension configuration tailored perfectly for a dedicated vertical 1080p monitor. A Pi Zero 2W with an LD2420 mmWave presence sensor can automatically turn the screen on/off via HDMI (see [Presence-Aware Screen Control](#presence-aware-screen-control) below).
* **📱 Mobile Web Client (`/dashboard`):** Fluid, glassmorphic (`backdrop-filter`) auto-wrapping card array matching the kiosk aesthetic while adjusting flawlessly to handheld touch screens.
* **🤖 Telegram Bot Dispatcher:** A Python-driven SQLite backend layer acting as a remote management pipeline. Interacts with the family on the go to inject custom sticky notes, manipulate real-time grocery lists, and handle calendar adjustments.
* **📡 Async MQTT Service Broker:** The real-time messaging highway utilizing Mosquitto to stream state changes across layouts instantly.
* **🏡 Home Assistant Engine integration:** Pushes live local system data such as regional precise Adhan times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and localized weather conditions.

🚀 Deployment Guide
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your host server machine:
```
curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com) -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

2. Environment Configurations

Two `.env` files are needed — one for the backend, one for the frontend.

**Backend `.env` (root directory):**
Copy `.env-example` to `.env` in the project root and fill in your details:

```
MQTT_BROKER=your_mqtt_broker_ip
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USER=your_mqtt_username
MQTT_PASS=your_mqtt_password
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
HA_URL=http://your-ha-instance:8123
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_ha_token
TZ=Europe/London
```

**Frontend `.env` (`dashboard/` directory):**
Copy `dashboard/.env-example` to `dashboard/.env` and fill in your MQTT WebSocket details:

```
VITE_MQTT_BROKER_WS=ws://your-mqtt-ip:9001
VITE_MQTT_USER=your_mqtt_username
VITE_MQTT_PASS=your_mqtt_password
```

3. Build Frontend Assets & Start Containers

Build the React app (npm — the Pi Zero 2W ships with Node v20, pnpm requires ≥v22):

```
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

Then copy `meal_plan.json-example` to `meal_plan.json` and update with your weekly meal plan.

Finally, start everything:

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

## 📡 Integrations

Home Assistant YAML example files are provided in the `HomeAssistant/` folder. Copy them into your HA configuration and update entity IDs for your own devices.

## 👤 Presence-Aware Screen Control (Pi Zero 2W Kiosk)

The repo includes a Python daemon that reads an **LD2420 mmWave presence sensor** via UART and controls the kiosk monitor power via **HDMI-CEC** based on proximity. It also publishes presence state to MQTT and subscribes to `home/dashboard/kitchen/screen/set` for optional Home Assistant override.

### Wiring

| LD2420 | Pi Zero 2W |
|--------|-----------|
| VIN | Pin 2 (5V) |
| GND | Pin 6 (GND) |
| OT1 (TX) | Pin 8 (GPIO14 / TXD) |
| RX | Pin 10 (GPIO15 / RXD) |

> The LD2420 module has an onboard voltage regulator — use **5V**, not 3.3V.

### Enable UART on DietPi

```bash
# In /boot/config.txt, add:
echo "enable_uart=1" | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
echo "dtoverlay=disable-bt" | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt

# Disable Bluetooth serial
sudo systemctl disable hciuart

# Reboot
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, `/dev/serial0` should exist.

### Install & configure

```bash
cd ~/family-dashboard

# Install Python deps
pip install pyserial paho-mqtt

# Copy and edit config
cp presence_config.env.example presence_config.env
nano presence_config.env
```

Set your MQTT broker IP, credentials, and enable HDMI-CEC in `presence_config.env`:
```
HDMI_POWER_CONTROL=true
```

### Test

```bash
python3 presence_daemon.py
```

Stand in front of the sensor — logs show `target=True dist=30 screen=on`. Walk away — screen turns OFF after ~2s release delay (respecting a 60s minimum on-time to prevent flickering).

### Auto-start on boot

```bash
sudo cp presence-daemon.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable presence-daemon
sudo systemctl start presence-daemon
```

### Behaviour

| Condition | Screen |
|-----------|--------|
| Person detected within range | Turns ON via CEC (~2s) |
| Person stays present | Stays ON |
| Person leaves | Turns OFF after ~2s release delay (minimum 60s on-time enforced) |
| MQTT `ON`/`OFF` command received | Home Assistant override (bypasses min on-time) |

### MQTT topics

| Topic | Direction | Payload |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `home/dashboard/kitchen/presence` | Daemon publishes | `{"presence": true/false, "distance": 30, ...}` |
| `home/dashboard/kitchen/screen/set` | Daemon subscribes | `ON` or `OFF` |
| `homeassistant/binary_sensor/kitchen_presence_ld2420/config` | MQTT Discovery | HA entity definition |

The daemon publishes 12 MQTT Discovery entities (binary sensor, distance, moving/still energy, detection state, status, gate energies 0–2).

## 🤖 Here is the complete list of triggers and keywords to use with your Telegram Bot.

Your bot relies on regular expressions (re.search and pattern matching) to parse your messages. It doesn't matter if you type them in UPPERCASE, lowercase, or Sentence Case—the backend handles them cleanly.
