# 🏢 Dynamic Family Hub Dashboard & Telemetry Stream

A premium, ambient dark-mode home automation command center designed for multi-profile layouts. This ecosystem handles dual-frontend presentation layers seamlessly syncing via an asynchronous MQTT pipeline connected to Home Assistant integrations and a Telegram chatbot orchestration layer.

---

## ⚡ Architecture Overview

The system is fully containerized and broken down into isolated service meshes routed natively via Nginx:

* **🖥️ Kiosk Interface (`/kiosk`):** Hard-locked portrait dimension configuration tailored perfectly for a dedicated vertical 1080p monitor.
* **📱 Mobile Web Client (`/dashboard`):** Fluid, glassmorphic (`backdrop-filter`) auto-wrapping card array matching the kiosk aesthetic while adjusting flawlessly to handheld touch screens.
* **🤖 Telegram Bot Dispatcher:** A Python-driven SQLite backend layer acting as a remote management pipeline. Interacts with the family on the go to inject custom sticky notes, manipulate real-time grocery lists, and handle calendar adjustments.
* **📡 Async MQTT Service Broker:** The real-time messaging highway utilizing Mosquitto to stream state changes across layouts instantly.
* **🏡 Home Assistant Engine integration:** Pushes live local system data such as regional precise Adhan times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and localized weather conditions.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **Frontend UI:** React.js, Vite, HTML5 Canvas/CSS Grid, Glassmorphic Styling Matrix
* **Brokerage Layer:** Eclipse Mosquitto (MQTT over WebSockets & standard TCP)
* **Proxy Routing:** Nginx
* **Orchestration Engine:** Docker Compose
* **Backend Automation:** Python 3, `python-telegram-bot`, `paho-mqtt`, SQLite3
* **Home Automation Hub:** Home Assistant (Jinja2 Templates & MQTT Publish actions)

🚀 Deployment Guide
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your host server machine:
```
curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com) -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

2. Environment Configurations
Create a local .env configuration template in the root directory (Note: This file is intentionally hidden from Git tracking for protection):
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_secure_api_token_here
MQTT_BROKER=your_mqtt_broker_ip
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USER=your_mqtt_username
MQTT_PASS=your_mqtt_password
```
# Optional — enables forwarding sticky notes to Home Assistant as events
```
HA_URL=http://your-ha-instance:8123
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_ha_token
```
3. Spin Up the Container Infrastructure
Compile your deployment profile production assets and start the system containers detached:

# Build frontend assets via Vite
```
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```
# Launch core runtime structures
```
docker compose up -d --build
```

Home Assistant Prayer Times Sync Payload
The layout receives flat JSON data payloads over the home/dashboard/prayer_times topic. Use the following dynamic automation configuration inside Home Assistant to broadcast automatically at midnight and system boots:
```
alias: "Dashboard: Sync Prayer Times"
mode: single
triggers:
  - at: "00:05:00"
    trigger: time
  - event: start
    trigger: homeassistant
actions:
  - action: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: home/dashboard/prayer_times
      retain: true
      payload: '{"Fajr":"{{ as_timestamp(states("sensor.salah_fajr"), default=0) | timestamp_custom("%I:%M %p", true, "12:00 AM") }}","Dhuhr":"{{ as_timestamp(states("sensor.salah_dhuhr"), default=0) | timestamp_custom("%I:%M %p", true, "12:00 AM") }}","Asr":"{{ as_timestamp(states("sensor.salah_asr"), default=0) | timestamp_custom("%I:%M %p", true, "12:00 AM") }}","Maghrib":"{{ as_timestamp(states("sensor.salah_maghrib"), default=0) | timestamp_custom("%I:%M %p", true, "12:00 AM") }}","Isha":"{{ as_timestamp(states("sensor.salah_isha"), default=0) | timestamp_custom("%I:%M %p", true, "12:00 AM") }}"}'

Here is the complete dictionary of command triggers and keywords your Telegram Dispatch Bot listens for.

Your bot relies on regular expressions (re.search and pattern matching) to parse your messages. It doesn't matter if you type them in UPPERCASE, lowercase, or Sentence Case—the backend handles them cleanly.

🛒 1. Smart Grocery & Shopping List
To manage the shopping list, the bot looks for phrases at the very beginning of your message or lines starting with structural list symbols.

Add Items: 
```
* buy  (e.g., buy milk and bread)

need  (e.g., need eggs)

add to shopping list 

add to shopping 

add to grocery 

add to groceries 

add  (when used as a single word or general prefix)

List symbols (Multi-line parsing): Starting a line with -, *, ▫️, or • will instantly split and add those lines as individual groceries.

Remove / Delete Items:

remove  (e.g., remove milk)

delete 

bought 

clear shopping list or clear shopping (Wipes the entire list clean)
```
📅 2. Family Schedule & Appointments
The bot splits calendar inputs into two categories: Explicit dates (handled locally by your SQLite database) and Dynamic relative adjustments (shipped to Home Assistant).

Add Permanent Calendar Entries:
```
schedule  (e.g., schedule dentist on 12/07 at 3pm)

appt 

appointment 

event 

calendar 

Key parsing triggers inside the text: The bot scans the message for date patterns like DD/MM, DD-MM, or explicitly stated keywords like at, on, or pm/am to separate the event name from its timestamp.

Remove / Cancel Appointments:

cancel schedule  (followed by the item index number or text fragment)

cancel appt 

cancel appointment 

delete schedule 

delete appt 

clear appointments or clear schedule (Wipes the local manual entries)
```
📋 3. Active Sticky Notes
Sticky notes act as broadcast notices for the family. They display at the bottom of the layout until explicitly removed.

Add Pinned Notes:
```
note  (e.g., note: plumber arriving tomorrow morning)

memo 

remind 

sticky 

Remove / Archive Notes:

remove note  (followed by the item index number, e.g., remove note 1)

delete note 

clear notes (Wipes all pinned notices instantly)
```
🍽️ 4. Ad-Hoc Meal & Food Planning
Your bot features an automated static baseline (the WEEKLY_MEAL_PLAN array inside your frontend bundle), but you can dynamically overwrite any specific day using Telegram commands.

Override Daily Menu:
```
menu  (e.g., menu monday burgers)

eat  (e.g., eat friday pizza take out)

food 

meal 

Target Day Keywords: The bot evaluates the word immediately following your food trigger to see which day slot to modify. It accepts:

monday / mon

tuesday / tue

wednesday / wed

thursday / thu

friday / fri

saturday / sat

sunday / sun

today / tomorrow (Automatically resolves into the exact day of the week based on your server clock)

Reset to Defaults:

clear menu or clear meal plan (Removes database overrides and falls right back to your default hardcoded structural rotation layout)
```
🛠️ 5. General Utility & Diagnostics
/start – Greets you, builds baseline database structures if they're missing, and prints a helpful instructional layout map directly into your chat window.


🔐 Security & Safety Notice
All sensitive database entries (*.db), persistent system logs (logs/), localized runtime keys (.env), and security credentials directories (mosquitto/config/passwd) are explicitly managed by standard root boundaries and strictly filtered out via the workspace .gitignore array.
