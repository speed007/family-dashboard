# 🏢 Dynamic Family Hub Dashboard With Home Assistant

Disclaimer: I am not a programmer! I do this as a hobby and because I like to break stuff! Enjoy!

A premium, ambient dark-mode home automation command center designed for multi-profile layouts. This ecosystem handles dual-frontend presentation layers seamlessly syncing via an asynchronous MQTT pipeline connected to Home Assistant integrations and a Telegram chatbot orchestration layer.

## Please Note 
You will need to create a bot in your Telegram account, many tutorials are out there. You will need TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TARGET_CHAT_ID to be put into .env file, use the files provided with -example and just remove "-example" from them and they are good to go with your own details.

## Where to run?
I am running this on a proxmox LXC instance but you can run on Raspbery Pi from Zero 2W upto Pi 5! 
You can also run on an old pc/laptop. The project really doesnt need much resources.
* For Kiosk LCD screen/monitor in Portrait mode, all it would need is a sigle webpage of "http://yourIntance'sIP:8080/kiosk" this can be run on Pi Zero W2 with dietPi and chromium which would launch at startup without any desktop with above url, this is 1080p portrait setup. 
* You can access non kiosk dashboard at "http://yourIntance'sIP:8080/dashboard" From any PC/Laptop, Mobile Phone or Tablet.

## ⚡ Architecture Overview

* **🖥️ Kiosk Interface (`/kiosk`):** Hard-locked portrait dimension configuration tailored perfectly for a dedicated vertical 1080p monitor.
* **📱 Mobile Web Client (`/dashboard`):** Fluid, glassmorphic (`backdrop-filter`) auto-wrapping card array matching the kiosk aesthetic while adjusting flawlessly to handheld touch screens.
* **🤖 Telegram Bot Dispatcher:** A Python-driven SQLite backend layer acting as a remote management pipeline. Interacts with the family on the go to inject custom sticky notes, manipulate real-time grocery lists, and handle calendar adjustments.
* **📡 Async MQTT Service Broker:** The real-time messaging highway utilizing Mosquitto to stream state changes across layouts instantly.
* **🏡 Home Assistant Engine integration:** Pushes live local system data such as regional precise Adhan times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and localized weather conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **Frontend UI:** React.js, Vite, HTML5 Canvas/CSS Grid, Glassmorphic Styling Matrix
* **Brokerage Layer:** Eclipse Mosquitto (MQTT over WebSockets & standard TCP)
* **Proxy Routing:** Nginx
* **Orchestration Engine:** Docker Compose
* **Backend Automation:** Python 3, `python-telegram-bot`, `paho-mqtt`, SQLite3
* **Home Automation Hub:** Home Assistant (Jinja2 Templates & MQTT Publish actions)

🚀 Deployment Guide
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your host server machine:
```
curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com) -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

2. Environment Configurations
Create a local .env configuration template in the root directory (Note: This file is intentionally hidden from Git tracking for protection):
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_secure_api_token_here
MQTT_BROKER=your_mqtt_broker_ip
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USER=your_mqtt_username
MQTT_PASS=your_mqtt_password
```
# Optional — enables forwarding sticky notes to Home Assistant as events
```
HA_URL=http://your-ha-instance:8123
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_ha_token
```
3. Spin Up the Container Infrastructure
Compile your deployment profile production assets and start the system containers detached:

# Build frontend assets via Vite
```
cd dashboard && npm install && npm install npx && npx run build && cd ..
```
# Launch core runtime structures
```
docker compose up -d --build
```
📡 Integrations

Home Assistant yaml example files are provided in a seperate folder you can use them and change necessory details for your own Devices and Entities.

## 🤖 Here is the complete dictionary of command triggers and keywords your Telegram Dispatch Bot listens for.

Your bot relies on regular expressions (re.search and pattern matching) to parse your messages. It doesn't matter if you type them in UPPERCASE, lowercase, or Sentence Case—the backend handles them cleanly.
